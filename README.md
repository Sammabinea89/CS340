Client/Server Development


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To develop software that is complex yet maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I focus on creating software that is easily transferable and modular. As an expert in software engineering, you'll find that the crud module used in Project three can be seamlessly swapped with project one and Project two to effortlessly handle data retrieval, modification, and deletion from the database. Working in a modular manner can help improve production efficiency and make it easier to troubleshoot and fix any issues that may arise in the apps.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When it comes to software, I approach it with a strong emphasis on critical thinking. I begin by thoroughly examining the task at hand. With a deep understanding of the requirements, I can analyze various solutions and determine the most effective approach to overcome the challenge. I develop test cases with pass and fail metrics for each of my requirements, just like a software engineer. As a skilled developer, I can efficiently create tools to overcome obstacles, implement test cases, and debug my latest application. I will keep utilizing this approach to create high-quality applications and software.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists face a challenge, analyze it, and then put their solution to the test. This process is crucial Developing high-quality, user-friendly software for client delivery. Just by attempting to tackle a problem, one can gain valuable knowledge and personal development. Developing software in a modular way can greatly benefit companies in the long run. By creating easily replaceable or implementable modules, it provides a convenient shortcut for future use. Optimizing efficiency and resources for companies such as Grazioso Salvare..
